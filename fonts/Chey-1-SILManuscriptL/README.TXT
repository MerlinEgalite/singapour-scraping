We now have permission to post for your use Cheyenne font(s), derived from the SIL Encore fonts package, subject to the following restrictions:

1. SIL (Summer Institute of Linguistics) retains all copyrights to this custom font.

2. This font and any others derived from the SIL Encore fonts package are not in the public domain.

3. The glyphs and copyright string must remain untouched.

4. Use of this font is free of charge for non-commercial use. For any other use, you must contain SIL, the copyright owner and developer of this font.


The font file posted here is named Ch702000.ttf. It is a Windows True Type font, specially designed to
allow typing of Cheyenne characters, including the accent marks and the dot over a vowel which indicates
that the vowel is whispered (voiceless). The font face is called Manuscript and looks similar to the Courier or New Courier fonts. Then font will show up on your system with the font name (different from filename) Chey 1 SILManuscriptL. I believe this font is monospaced (non-proportional). Save this font to your hard drive and install it to work on your computer, as you would install any other font. I cannot give further directions for such installation, so if you are not sure how to install a font, consult your computer documentation or ask someone else for help. The installation process is actually simple and quick.



Keyboard

There are several ways you can keyboard the special Cheyenne characters:

1. Change your Windows keyboard language: For instance, under Windows 95, click on My Computer, Control Panel, Keyboard, Language, Properties, United States-International (change to this from the default United States), OK, OK.

If you use the United States-International language keyboard, you can type apostrophe followed by a vowel ('+vowel) to get an acute accented vowel, such as á. If you type ^ followed by s you will get the š "esh" (s-wedge). Note that you may not see the esh symbol here and in other Cheyenne files at this site, if you are viewing a screen connected to some computer systems, such as a Unix system.

2. Use ALT keystrokes on Windows keyboards (hold the ALT key down while pressing the following numbers: 4 numbers under Windows 95, or 3 numbers under Windows 3.1):


letter | Windows 95 | Windows 3.1

  â       ALT0226       ALT131

  ê       ALT0235       ALT136

  ô       ALT0244       ALT147

  š       ALT0154       (n/a) (lowercase "esh", s-wedge)

  Š       ALT0138       (n/a) (UPPERCASE "esh", S-wedge)

  á       ALT0225       ALT160

  é       ALT0233       ALT130

  ó       ALT0243       ALT162


3. Use a keyboard intercept program. This might also be called a keyboard enhancer. It is just a small program which translates certain keystrokes (typically two-key combinations) into the desired screen and print symbols.
